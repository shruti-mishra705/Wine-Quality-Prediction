# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction System

A machine learning project that predicts the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using multiple ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The app is built using Streamlit for an interactive UI and includes data preprocessing and feature scaling for accurate real-time predictions.
